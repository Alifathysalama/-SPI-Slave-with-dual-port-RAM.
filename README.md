# -SPI-Slave-with-dual-port-RAM.
this project is to enable seamless communication and data transfer between the master device and the peripheral    devices using the SPI protocol. By incorporating a dual-port RAM, the project ensures efficient and reliable data exchange, allowing the devices to interact and share information effectively.
